# Cat & Dog classification with Resnet50 and SVM

This project uses the ResNet50 model for feature extraction and SVM (Support Vector Machine) for classification to distinguish between cat and dog images. The application is built with Flask and deployed on Render, offering a web interface where users can upload images and receive classification results.
